# Moodtracks

For our final project we created an app called Moodtracks. Moodtracks is a simple journal and mood tracking app. With Mood Tracks you can easily document your day by writing journal entries, tracking your feelings, and adding a photo to remember special moments. Turn your reflections into personal growth and cultivate mindfulness and emotional wellness with Mood Tracks.
